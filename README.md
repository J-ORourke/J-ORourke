- 👋 Hi, I’m @J-ORourke
- 👀 I’m interested in "why? and how?" but also skiing with my family and an excess of other hobbies.
- 🌱 I’m a metallurgical engineer involved in a large modelling project using python. As i had no idea how to program outside Excel, my employer offered me access to Data Camp.I am pushing throught the data scientist content, and devouring the extra units that look interesting. I have learned many ways i could use this new toolset in my normal role, but: so far I am using my new-found omnipotent knowledge exclusively for personal use - project 1 - monitor and control my greenhouse.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project that involves collecting real world data to an online user interface where actions can be triggered both manually and logically.
- 📫 How to reach me ... you can fire me a note at jimcorourke@gmail.com or see me at my fledgling site: www.jimoro.com
